      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Trippy began with a simple idea: to make travel more personal,
        accessible, and unforgettable. What started as a passion project among a
        group of wanderlust-driven friends in 2018 has now grown into a trusted
        travel platform for explorers across the globe.Born from countless
        backpacking trips, missed buses, spontaneous discoveries, and hidden
        gems, Trippy was created to share real, meaningful travel
        experiences—not just tourist checklists. We wanted to build more than a
        site—we aimed to create a community of curious travelers who believe
        that every trip can change the way we see the world.

        experiences, hidden gems, and local cultures that create unforgettable
        memories.
